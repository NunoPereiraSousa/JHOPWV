# JHOPWV

Back in
2000, JHOPWV, a Non-Profit Organization realized that by working together we
could overcome our challenges much more efficiently, and that is why
we ultimately decided to launch JHOPWV.

JHOPWV knows that our strength lies not only in the words we stand by,
but most importantly through the actions of our initiatives.
