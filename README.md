# JHOPWV

JHOPWV knows that our strength lies not only in the words we stand by,
but most importantly through the actions of our initiatives. Back in
2000, our Non-Profit Organization realized that by working together we
could overcome our challenges much more efficiently, and that is why
we ultimately decided to launch JHOPWV.
