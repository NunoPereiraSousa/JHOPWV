# JHOPWV

Back in 2000, a Non-Profit Organization realized that by working together they
could overcome their challenges much more efficiently, and that is why
they ultimately decided to launch JHOPWV.

JHOPWV knows that their strength lies not only in the words they stand by,
but most importantly through the actions of their initiatives.
